## Advanced Lane Finding

This is my solution to Udacity Self-driving car term 1's project 4. More information can be found at its original github
repo: https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines

To run this solution, grab the necessary resources (camera_cal/*, test_images/* and project_video.mp4) from the github
repo above. Then step through the advanced_lane_finding.ipynb.
